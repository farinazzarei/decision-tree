# decision tree from scratch

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using only NumPy â€” without relying on any machine learning libraries. It is applied to the **Iris dataset**.
It walks through the logic behind splitting criteria, entropy calculations, and recursive tree building.
At the end, the results are compared with DecisionTreeClassifier from the scikit-learn library to evaluate accuracy.
